 Development Guidelines
========================

   :Release: |version|
   :Date: |today|

We have adopted many developer guidelines in an effort to make
development easy, and the source code readable, consistent and robust.
Many of our guidelines are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.
We welcome new developers to the effort, if you're interested in
developing code or documentation please join the `nipy mailing list`_
and introduce yourself.  If you plan to do any code development, we
ask that you take a look at the following guidelines.  We do our best
to follow these guidelines ourselves:

* `Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines:
  <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
  This is the coding style we strive to maintain.
