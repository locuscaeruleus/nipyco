Guidelines
==========

We have adopted many developer guidelines in an effort to make
development easy, and the source code readable, consistent and robust.
Many of our guidelines are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.
We welcome new developers to the effort, if you're interested in
developing code or documentation please join the `nipy mailing list`_
and introduce yourself.  If you plan to do any code development, we
ask that you take a look at the following guidelines.  We do our best
to follow these guidelines ourselves:

* :ref:`howto_document` : Documentation is critical.  This document
  describes the documentation style, syntax, and tools we use.

* `Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines:
  <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
  This is the coding style we strive to maintain.

* :ref:`testing` : We've adopted a rigorous testing framework.

* :ref:`optimization`: "premature optimization is the root of all
  evil."
