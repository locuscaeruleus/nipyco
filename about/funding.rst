Continued Development And Maintenance Of The Neuroimaging In Python Project
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

University Of California Berkeley

from National Institute Of Mental Health, IRG: ZRG1

*Abstract:* This grant proposes the continued maintenance, testing, and
evaluation of the Neuroimaging in Python (NiPy) project. In particular,
we propose to apply best practices and proven methods for software design,
construction, and implementation to extend the applicability of NiPy to
the larger neuroimaging research community. By addressing the parallel
achievements and increased interdependence of neuroimaging research and
computing sciences, we will benefit the existing NiPy user community as
well as increasing the potential for NiPy to attract significantly more
developers and users. We will modernize, refactor, and further develop
NiPy into an easy to modify and extend software environment with the
ability to be repaired and evolved as the needs of the community of users
change. Working closely with the existing NiPy developer community, we aim
to improve and enhance NiPy in terms of infrastructure, architecture,
interoperability, usability, and reproducibility

AND BIOENGINEERING 

*Abstract:* The general aim of this project is to disseminate software
 that will enhance the quality and consistency of analysis of
 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The goal is to
 enhance, document and make publicly available software for artifact
 detection, statistical region-of-interest analysis and visualization
 of fMRI data. Better quality control methods and statistical methods
 will generate more credible and repeatable results, which should
 therefore lead to faster biomedical discoveries and to potential
 reduction in the cost of running fMRI studies. From a software
 engineering standpoint, the goal is to offer a well-designed, cross-
 platform, extensible software that is intuitive and easy to use. 
Custom modules will be created for use of this software within some functional
 analysis streams (FMRIB Software Library, FSL, Smith et al., 2004,
 Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM, Friston 2003, FreeSurfer
 Functional Analysis STream, FSFAST, Tsao et al., 2003 and
 Neuroimaging in Python, NiPy), and support will be provided to embed
 the software in other analysis streams. 

*PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:* The proposed project aims to
 disseminate software for sophisticated statistical analyses
 (Nieto-Castanon et al., 2003) and quality control of functional
 magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Providing these tools should
 enable users of fMRI technology to produce more detailed, consistent
 and reliable results. This will lead to better understanding of how
 the brain works and thereby directly impact approaches to diagnosing
 and treating neurological disorders.
