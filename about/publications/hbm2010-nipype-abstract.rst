Introduction
------------

Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to
analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying
assumptions. However, this has resulted in a heterogeneous collection
of specialized applications without transparent interoperability or a
uniform operating interface. Nipype, an open-source,
community-developed initiative under the umbrella of Nipy, is a Python
project that solves these issues by providing a uniform interface to
existing neuroimaging software and by facilitating interaction between
these packages within a single workflow. 

Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration
of algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL), eases the
design of workflows within and between packages, and reduces the
learning curve necessary to use different packages.  Nipype is
creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software
development in a high-level language and addressing limitations of
existing pipeline systems.


Methods
-------

The Nipype architecture (Fig. 1) consists of a set of interfaces and a
pipeline framework that provide uniform access to and interoperability
between external software packages.

The interfaces encapsulate functional components (e.g., brain extraction, realignment)
from external packages (e.g., FSL, SPM) and provide a uniform access
mechanism to these components. Users can introspect individual
algorithms, query and set their parameters, and execute, retrieve and
visualize outputs interactively from a Python prompt. The pipeline
framework provides the mechanism to connect interfaces to form a
complete analysis workflow and execute it. The workflow is represented
in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), enabling orderly execution and
ensuring operational consistency (see Fig. 2 for an example
workflow).

The pipeline component enables distributed processing (on multicores,
clusters, and clouds), allows parameter sweeping across workflows,
provides interoperability between packages, and easy re-analysis and
visualization of workflows. When a workflow is re-analyzed, the
pipeline engine executes only nodes whose input parameters and/or data
files have changed from the previous run, eliminating redundant
execution.

Nipype is available on SourceForge (http://nipy.sf.net/nipype) and is
written in Python, a free high-level language accessible to both
programmers and non-programmers with extensive scientific computation
capabilities. Nipype is documented using a light-weight markup
language called reStructuredText, from which print-quality HTML and
PDF documentation are generated.
The source code is tested using the Nose Python testing
framework to ensure robustness and to allow for easier code
maintenance. Nipype is released frequently to provide users with
prompt bug fixes and feature updates, and is also available as part of
NeuroDebian (http://www.neurodebian.org) and as part of any Debian
derivatives (e.g., Ubuntu).

Results
-------

Nipype has been in use at UC Berkeley, University of Edinburgh, MGH,
MIT, and UW Seattle on a wide range of projects. These include: 1)
large pediatric and psychiatric studies; 2) MRI, fMRI, DTI and PET
studies; and 3) a variety of cognitive and experimental paradigms. In
all of these cases, the advantages of using Nipype have been: a) use
of different software through a single interface; b) avoidance of
redundant expensive computations; c) reduction of duplication of data
in workflows; d) distribution of computational load across file-system
sharing clusters; e) tracking of exact parameters and components of
the analyses; and f) visualization of the workflows.

The ability to interact with external programs from a single
Python-prompt aids in learning about new tools and developing new 
workflows. The pipeline mechanism allows easy comparisons of
algorithms and their influence on an entire workflow. It
allows researchers to use optimized algorithms from different packages
in the same workflow. Unlike existing pipeline systems, Nipype
supports both SPM and non-SPM workflows within the same architecture.

By integrating interfaces to FSL and FreeSurfer, Nipype enables SPM
workflows to leverage different volume- and surface-based structural
analysis components (e.g., Fig 2). The workflow in Fig. 2 combines
surface-based smoothing with an SPM-based first-level analysis. The
resultant contrast images were then used for a FreeSurfer-based
group-analysis using surface-based spherical registration.

A key benefit to using Nipype over other pipeline systems is that
developers can create and test algorithms with a high-level language
environment and enable researchers to use the algorithms without being
restricted to specific packages. For example, ArtifactDetect, an fMRI
diagnostics tool maintained as a Matlab-based SPM toolbox, is
now available as a Nipype plugin to FSL users and appropriately
modifies both SPM and FSL generated design matrices to discard
outliers.

Conclusion
----------

Nipype provides an environment for interactive manipulation of data
through a Python interface as well as for performing reproducible,
distributed analysis using the pipeline system and has a growing
developer and user community. Nipype has encouraged the scientific
exploration of different algorithms and associated parameters, eased
the development of workflows within and between packages and reduced
the learning curve associated with understanding the algorithms, APIs
and user interfaces of disparate packages. Future plans include
adding: interfaces to other analysis tools (e.g., AFNI, ANTS, Slicer),
a direct interface to the Nipy statistical analysis framework, the
ability to query data and workflows, a repository for workflows
(cf. myExperiment.org), and infrastructure for using Nipype as a
teaching tool.
