Introduction
------------

What is Nipy, what is Nipype?
What is it like to do an analysis ideosycratic apis
Expert user to use different apis
limitations of existing pipelines, and
LONI pipeline and fiswidgets
Problem of application specific pipelines


Methods
-------

Architecture, basic pipeline model
compenent architecture diagram
interfaces
why python
infrastructure (hosting, docs, releases, trac, testing)
open collaborative development
international
Graph visualization of pipeline
Parallel (ref Fernando)


Results
-------

Used at MIT BErkeley MGH
DTI?
Used on motor tasks, perception, PET, ...
avoidance of redundant expensive computation, reduces duplication in
parallel or nearly parallel pipelines
Encourages exploration of algorithm parameter changes



Very reproducible
easy to keep track of whats been done, and how



Conclusion
----------

Growing developer community
Future plans
(add afni,  ANTS, direct interface to nipy)
Good opportunity for comparative validation of tools and algorithms
Data more sematically annotated (go into detail)
query on data,
Web interface
running on large cluster with Large Scale studies
instituion wide stnadardized diagnostics

facilitates training
