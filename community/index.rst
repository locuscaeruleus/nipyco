The nipy_ community is two things.  Of course it is the collection of
:ref:`projects` that we are involved in.  We also hope it will be a forum for
discussing how to make software that helps people think.  Of course, we hope
that we will ourselves become a group that is good at thinking and discussing, a
process that takes a long time of learning.
